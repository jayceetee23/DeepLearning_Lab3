Description: Results from 67 ESP experiments in 3 categories:
1) Ganzfeld   2) Nonganzfeld with noise reduction   3) Standard free response
Each trial is classified by: # trials, # Successes, z-score and 2 effect size
measures. Studies 7 and 11 have different numbers than original paper.
Z computed as follows (not all match authors' given z-values).
p0 = 1/#choices   p_hat = #Success/#Trials = y/n

p_hat >= p0   Z = (y - np0 - 0.5) / sqrt(n*p0*(1-p0))
p_hat < p0   Z = (y - np0 + 0.5) / sqrt(n*p0*(1-p0))

Effect Size 1: Z/sqrt(n)
Effect Size 2 (Cohen's h): 2*(arcsin(sqrt(p_hat)) - arcsin(sqrt(p0)))
