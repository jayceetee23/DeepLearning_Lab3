6th Question

Using LSTM model, we got 62% accuracy over 50.48% with CNN model. Thus, for this case, LSTM is clearly a better way to go.

Holding other Hyperparameters constant:
 
1-When added more layers to CNN, accuracy increased from 50.48% to 50.55%.

2-When changed the Epoch from 2 to 5 in CNN model, accuracy increased from 50.48% to 50.81%.

3-When used “Sigmoid” instead of “Relu” in CNN model, accuracy remained unchanged at 50.48%.

4-When used “Tanh” instead of “Relu” in CNN model, accuracy increased from 50.48% to 50.91%.

5-When changed learning rate from 0.01 to 0.02 in CNN model, accuracy increased from 50.48% to 50.82%.
